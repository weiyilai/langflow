# Langflow Documentation (full)

> Comprehensive guide for AI language models: Langflow documentation at docs.langflow.org. Covers the visual flow builder, API and webhook triggers, MCP, deployment, components, and API reference. Use this file for deeper context than llms.txt.

**Platform overview**
Official documentation for Langflow, a low-code platform for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Type: Technical Documentation – AI Development Platform. URL: https://docs.langflow.org. Category: Developer Documentation, AI/ML, Workflow Automation, RAG, MCP. Target: developers and teams adopting Langflow (OSS or Desktop) for AI applications.

**Technical specifications (Langflow product)**
Application type: Python web application (OSS); Tauri-based desktop (Langflow Desktop). Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux. Minimum requirements: Windows 10 (64-bit), macOS 10.15 Catalina, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or equivalent; 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended), 2GB storage, internet for model integrations; Python 3.10–3.13 for OSS. Architecture: modular component system. License: MIT. Runtime: Python 3.10–3.13 (OSS); Node.js and Python (Desktop). Package format: pip/uv (OSS), Docker image, native Desktop installers (.exe, .dmg, .deb/.rpm). Default URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860. Repository: https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow.

**Core features (by doc section)**
Get Started: about, installation, quickstart, tutorials (RAG, files, agents, MCP). Flows: visual editor, build flows, API and webhook triggers, playground, import/export. Agents: agents and tools, MCP client/server/Astra. Develop: API keys, custom dependencies, config and globals, env vars, storage and memory, observability (LangSmith, LangFuse, etc.), data types, voice mode, CLI. Deploy: overview, public server, Nginx/SSL, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP/Hugging Face/Railway/Render, security. Components: concepts, core components, bundles (integrations), custom components. API Reference: get started, TypeScript client, flow/OpenAI/files/projects/logs/monitor/build/users endpoints, API spec. Contribute: community, how to contribute, components, bundles, tests, templates. Support: troubleshooting, get help, Luna/IBM, release notes.

**Page structure**
Get Started: about, install, quickstart, tutorials. Flows: visual editor, triggers, playground, import/export. Agents: agents, MCP. Develop: config, storage, observability, CLI. Deploy: overview, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud, security. Components: concepts, core, bundles, custom. API Reference: getting started, endpoints, spec. Contribute: community, contributing. Support: troubleshooting, help, release notes.

**Installation**
OSS: uv pip install langflow -U; uv run langflow run. Docker: docker run -p 7860:7860 langflowai/langflow:latest. From source: make run_cli. First use: UI at 127.0.0.1:7860, configure API keys, build or import flows, trigger via API or webhooks.

**Use cases**
RAG applications, multi-agent workflows, MCP servers and clients, API-backed AI services, document processing, custom components and bundles, deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, cloud). Target users: developers, data scientists, devops, contributors.

**Support**
Documentation sections: get started, flows, agents, develop, deploy, components, API, contribute, support. Community: Discord, GitHub discussions, YouTube, release notes. Technical: GitHub issues, troubleshooting docs, IBM Elite Support (Luna).

**Privacy & security**
Deployment security and API keys/auth documented at docs.langflow.org. Repository: SECURITY.md and GitHub security advisories. Data handling and env vars in Develop section.

**Performance**
Default port 7860; observability docs (LangSmith, LangFuse, etc.); deployment best practices for scaling.
